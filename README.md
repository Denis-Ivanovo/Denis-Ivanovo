My name is Denis. I am from Russia, Ivanovskaya oblast`.
I have worked as an educator of chemistry and a scientifi—Å researcher in this field during last 14 years.
Currently, I want to become a QA engineer. In the beginning of 2022, I have finished a QA engineer course by Yandex.Practicum. 
During the course, I have learned basic priciples of manual testing (planing of testing, kinds of tests, 
test desing rules, frontend - backend interactions, softwares applied in QA testing 
(for instance, Charles, mobile apps (Android Studio), APIs(Postman), REST API, SQL requests, YML, JSON ). 
To dive more deeply into QA testing, I keep searching, reading and learning additional information related to QA. At the moment, I learn GitHub.
